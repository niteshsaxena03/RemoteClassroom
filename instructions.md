1. Create welcome page with 2 buttons → Login and Signup.
2. Login and Signup should redirect to Mode page.

4. After choosing Self‑Pace → go to Dashboard.
5. Dashboard has 2 sections → All Courses and My Courses.
6. All Courses shows list of available courses.
7. My Courses shows only the courses purchased by the user.
8. On clicking a purchased course → open Course Page and display its content (simple text or links from Firestore).
9. All backend will be done fully in Firebase (Auth + Firestore only, free tier).
10. Use Firebase Auth for login/signup.
11. Use Firestore for storing courses and purchases.
12. Use Context API to store and provide Firebase functions globally, so they are not scattered.
13. Keep UI in dark theme (green, blue, black, red in gradients).
14. Focus only on Self‑Pace Course Mode; AI Tutor stays as placeholder.

These are the only steps to follow — keep it simple and short.
